Must do:
 * Player animations
 * Make animation for heal
 * Startup screen
   * splash screen graphic
 * End-game animations:
   * player dies
   * enemy dies
 * End-game screen:
   * end-game graphic

Really want to do:
 * Design nicer player animations
 * Allow choosing a weapon:
   * Select weapon
   * Equip weapon
 * Create other items that the player can use
 * Make different images for enemy

Nice to have:
 * Add additional types of enemy
 * Improve/replace background
 * More spells

Done:
 * Using an item should remove it from inventory
 * Make enemy choose actions other than just attacking
 * Menu-based combat
   * Create keyboard menus
   * Write key handler for menu item selection
   * View inventory
* Startup screen
   * key handling for starting game
* End-game screen:
   * key handling for restarting game
 * Character selection at beginning of game
